SelectorPlus LangGraph Project Setup
This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the SelectorPlus LangGraph project.

Prerequisites
Docker: Ensure Docker is installed on your system.
Python 3.8+: Make sure Python 3.8 or a later version is installed.
Git: For cloning the repository.
Setup Instructions
Clone the Repository:

```Bash
git clone [<your_repository_url>](https://github.com/automateyournetwork/Selector-)
cd Selector-
```

Create a .env File:

In the root directory of your project, create a file named .env.

Copy and paste the following environment variables into the .env file:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=
WEATHER_API_KEY=
ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY=
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=""
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="SelectorPlus"
GITHUB_TOKEN=""
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=""
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=""
SLACK_TEAM_ID=""
SELECTOR_AI_API_KEY=
SELECTOR_URL=
```
 Important: Keep your .env file secure, as it contains sensitive API keys. Do not commit it to version control.

Build and Start the Docker Images:

Bash
```bash
./docker_startup.sh
```

# Run the LangGraph Application:

Navigate to the directory containing your main Python script (the one that runs the LangGraph application).

Run the Python script:

```Bash
python selectorplus.py
```

Interact with the Application:

Follow the prompts in the terminal to interact with your LangGraph application.

The application will use the Docker containers and environment variables to execute the tools and interact with external services.

Important Notes

API Keys: Ensure that all API keys are valid and have the necessary permissions.

Docker Containers: Make sure that all Docker containers are running correctly. You can check the status of your containers using docker ps.

Error Handling: Pay close attention to the logs and error messages in the terminal to diagnose any issues.

Security: Be cautious when handling API keys and sensitive information.

This README should provide a clear and concise guide to setting up and running your LangGraph project. If you encounter any issues, refer to the logs and error messages for further debugging.
